# VCS_Project2
Computer Vision and Cognitive Systems course's second project

### Detection and tracking from an IP camera
- You are given access to a real-time IP camera recording the campus
- The goal is to detect people and track them through time (keeping the
same identity as long as possible).
- Possibly, use both 2D and 3D information: you can calibrate the
camera and use an homography.
- You should record and use at least 10 videos
